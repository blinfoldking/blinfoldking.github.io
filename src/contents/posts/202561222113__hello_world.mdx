# Hello World

Hello.
As you may already know from the [Homepage](/), my name is Ganesha Danu.
I've been coding since i was 13 and being in the tech industry for 7 years (more or less). During those times i've tried various programming language from the worst (php) to maybe the best (zig).

With that being said, i plan to use this website as a mean to archive various things i learn (mostly programming stuff, but maybe some other random stuff too).

I also currently building a game prototype, hopefully i can share more about it in this website. but for now if you are curious, feel free to visit the itch.io page:
